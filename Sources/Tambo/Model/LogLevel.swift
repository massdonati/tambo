/**
 Defines the available levels of severity a log carries the informations of.
 The use of these levels are deffered to the user of this framework.
 - `error`: used when the application really is in trouble. Users are being affected
    without having a way to work around the issue.
 - `warning`: when something bad happened, but the application still has the chance to
    heal itself or the issue can wait a day or two to be fixed.
 - `info`: when something bad happened, but the application still has the chance to
    heal itself or the issue can wait a day or two to be fixed.
 - `debug`: any information that helps us identify what went wrong on DEBUG level.
    - error messages when an incoming HTTP request was malformed, resulting in a 4xx HTTP
        status
    - variable values in business logic.
 - `trace`:
